A type of production without loss that involves a template (e.g. the polymerization of a nucleic 
acid macromolecule from a nucleic acid macromolecule template).
The template reaction glyph should be used to describe transcription or translation, but 
the glyph itself is insufficient to distinguish between the two biological processes.
